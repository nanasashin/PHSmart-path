Web Base School Navigation System


Functions:
- Navigate the School by inputing an starting building and an ending building.
- Uses Dijkstra Algorithm to locate the most efficient path to point A to point B
- Entering a starting buidling and ending building will show the map with a navigated line to where you will follow.
- Below that will give you a picture of every location that you will pass by as you go to the ending building.


Need to FIX:
- The Horrendous UI
- The Images (I did not put the initial images here because I don't want to)
- The Unreadable Code (yep)
- Other things I'm too lazy to fix


PS. This is a 2nd year senior high school CAPSTONE project. Maybe I will fic it in the near future or maybe not idk.
